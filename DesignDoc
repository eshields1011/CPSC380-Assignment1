For this assignment, I used three separate threads apart from the main thread. One thread for checking the rows, one thread for checking the columns, and one thread for checking the 3x3 subgrids. Considering that sudoku revolves around those 3 rules, it made logical sense for me to divide my threads among those three tasks. Each thread has the same functionality: evaluate an array of nine numbers from the input sudoku grid and see if any of the numbers from 1-9 are missing in that array. However, each thread partitions the sudoku grid into different combinations to properly reflect the rows, columns, and 3x3 grids of an actual sudoku board. Any errors found were stored by the three helper threads and then given to the main thread, which cross-referenced the data across the helper threads to locate and solve and problems in the sudoku grid.
